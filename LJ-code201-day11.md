I have fallen behind and I'm totally ok with it. I'm really getting what I'm doing now and things are synthesizing. My exhaustion is clearing and I'm preparing myself to be a good team mate for next week.

I'm thinking I'll be able to do some good catch up this weekend and will focus on finishing labs and the quizes primarily, using the reading to support that effort.
