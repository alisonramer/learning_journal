<h1>The "Weird Day" of class - Day 1</h1>

How can I write in a journal without images?!

I'm really enjoying all of the new space that new abilities for expression that software development is providing -- even at this very elementary stage.
</p>

<p>
The code I wrote today in the lab, the "Good Day" code, was really fun and made me laugh. I enjoyed moving between writing the code and testing it in HTML.
</p>

<p>
I also really liked <a href = "http://ryanstutorials.net/problem-solving-skills/"> this article</a> about problem solving. And took these notes:<br><br>

 Ask these general questions (about anything and everything):
<br>
<il>What is it actually doing?
<il>How is it actually doing it?
<il>How effectively is it performing its purpose?
<il>Why is it doing it/ what would happen if it was taken out?
<il>What is it's relationship with other components?
<il>What could I do to test that assumption?

I'm really considering how I should share my experience here with my 'audience'. I wrote a personal statement that was really succinct  but I think I need to say more. I have a tumblr blog that I opened to focus on my design and development work. I also have of course, my website, facebook, twitter and other accounts.
<br>
I think this is a really exciting endeavour to be a part of -- bootcamp start-up -- and I feel like a bit of an experiment! So far, when I've shared with people they are really excited and impressed ...  which can have positive outcomes for me in regards to networking and connecting with other movers and shakers in the tech and social change communities. We will see!
