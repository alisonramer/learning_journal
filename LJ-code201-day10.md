Honestly, I'm frustrated today. I feel like I just am so slow and that even though I'm sure I will get it I feel like I am constantly behind and can't keep up with the pace. I just don't have it yet! Is what I keep reminding myself, but I wish I had more time to actually get it ... For example, the past two quizes I only had time to take once so far ... and I did miserably the first time! They are good indicators to show me that I have a lot more work and studying to do ... but I am not sure when I will have the time to do it... I'll keep trying, but I recognize that my learning curve is slow ... I'll get there some day!
